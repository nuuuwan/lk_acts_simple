The Personal Data Protection Act of Sri Lanka was passed in 2022. This law applies to the handling of personal information within Sri Lanka or by organizations that are based in Sri Lanka, including those that offer goods or services to people in Sri Lanka or monitor the behavior of people in Sri Lanka. However, it does not apply to personal information that is used for private or household purposes. This law takes precedence over other laws related to protecting personal data, but public authorities can follow their own laws as long as they protect data in line with this Act.
