This section outlines how personal data should be processed by those in charge of it, known as controllers. Personal data must be processed in a way that is legal and meets certain conditions. These conditions include specific purposes for collecting the data, ensuring the data is relevant and necessary for those purposes and keeping it accurate and up-to-date. Controllers must also ensure the security and confidentiality of personal data by using appropriate measures, such as encryption. Individuals have the right to know how their personal data is being used and have access to that information. Controllers must have an internal program to manage the processing of personal data, including safeguards and procedures to handle complaints and breaches of security.
