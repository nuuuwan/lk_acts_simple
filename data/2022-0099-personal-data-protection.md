# Preamble

This law is being made to regulate how companies and other organizations handle people's personal information. It's important to do this in a way that protects people's privacy while still allowing for innovation in the digital economy. The law will also make sure that different countries' rules for protecting personal data can work together better, and that there is an authority in charge of enforcing these rules. This is all to make sure that people's personal data is kept safe and people can trust that their privacy is being respected.

# Part 1

The Personal Data Protection Act of Sri Lanka was passed in 2022. This law applies to the handling of personal information within Sri Lanka or by organizations that are based in Sri Lanka, including those that offer goods or services to people in Sri Lanka or monitor the behavior of people in Sri Lanka. However, it does not apply to personal information that is used for private or household purposes. This law takes precedence over other laws related to protecting personal data, but public authorities can follow their own laws as long as they protect data in line with this Act.

# Part 2

This section outlines how personal data should be processed by those in charge of it, known as controllers. Personal data must be processed in a way that is legal and meets certain conditions. These conditions include specific purposes for collecting the data, ensuring the data is relevant and necessary for those purposes and keeping it accurate and up-to-date. Controllers must also ensure the security and confidentiality of personal data by using appropriate measures, such as encryption. Individuals have the right to know how their personal data is being used and have access to that information. Controllers must have an internal program to manage the processing of personal data, including safeguards and procedures to handle complaints and breaches of security.
